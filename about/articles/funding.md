# How is Glipo funded?
Glipo is funded through its users. We're a platform who believes that our users shouldn't have to see ads to have a good time on our site, and so we rely on generous donations from our userbase so that we can continue to keep the site active and running. All we ask is that our users donate to us, and when they have, we don't ask again. Donations can be big or small ─ any amount is appreciated and we're thankful for your support!

## Why no ads?
Having no ads makes our social network unique ─ there's not many websites nowadays that don't have ads. We also think that users may turn away from us because we serve up ads that they don't like, and so we've taken the decision to not show ads on our site. In some cases, we only ask you to donate to us so that we can continue to provide our services.

## Do we sell your data?
Glipo itself is against the sale of your data. It's one of the little things that sets Glipo apart from most other social networks. We take steps to make sure that our service providers don't sell off your data to third parties, as listed in our Privacy Policy.
