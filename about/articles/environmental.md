# Environmental promise
At Glipo, we regard environmental sustainability as an issue with high importance. We continue to make efforts in improving the sustainability of our products and services, as outlined in this document.

## Reducing our footprint
The environment has recently been impacted by technology over the past few years. From the start, we have made conscious decisions during Glipo's development which will continue to help the environment in the short- and long-term future. Some of the steps we've taken include:

* Offsetting 100% of our carbon emissions for our database and data processing systems
* Matching our electricity consumption levels with renewable electricity supply purchases
* Developing a lightweight, energy-efficient architecture which enables quicker and more sustainable browsing

## Promises for the future
Glipo and the parties on which Glipo depends upon is committed to switching to 100% renewable energy sources by 2030. Glipo also is committed to keeping environmental sustainability at the top of its agenda, ensuring that every decision which is made by Glipo Technologies is made with sustainability at the core of those decisions.

## Giving back
Glipo plans to run fundraisers which will help to improve both the climate sitation and the awareness about the changing environment. Glipo will give back to charities concerning environmental sustainability through these fundraisers. Additionally, Glipo advises that you stop reading this document, take a break, go outside and get a bit of fresh air.
