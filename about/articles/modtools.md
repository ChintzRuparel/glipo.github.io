# Using Glipo's group moderator tools
If you have created a group or if you've been made a moderator in someone else's group, you'll be able to access that group's moderator tools. To access the moderator tools for a specific group, visit the group page you'd like to moderate and then press the **Moderator tools** button (underneath the group **Join**/**Leave** button on the sidebar). On mobile, you can access the moderator tools under **Group info** > **Moderator tools**. If you're not a moderator of a group, you'll see the **Message moderators** button instead.

## Modqueue
The modqueue is where new posts that are submitted to your group will appear. These posts can then be individually approved or removed by using the **Approve** and **Remove** buttons, depending on whether you think the particular posts adhere to your group's rules. When you approve a post, the post will no longer appear on the modqueue. However, if you remove a post, you'll be asked for a removal reason which will be shown to the post author via message from u/modbot (our automated moderation handling account).

## Reports
The **Reports** tab lists the reports that have been sent from your group's members. When your group's members think that a particular post or comment violates your group's rules, they can use the **Report** button on that post/comment and then select the rule that they think was violated. In the moderator tools, you can check to see the why particular posts/comments were reported, and also an excerpt of the post/comment's contents (and title if it's a post) for you to review. Pressing the **Dismiss** button will remove the report from the list with no action taken. Pressing the **Act** button will then ask you to supply a reason for removal (the reason is autofilled with an appropriate reason depending on the type or report â”€ you can change the reason to something more fitting). You'll also have the option to send a message containing the reason via u/modbot to the author. Once you have supplied a reason, the offending post/comment will be removed and the report will also be removed from list.

## Modmail
Your group's members can message you via the modmail system, and modmail messages will appear on the **Modmail** tab. Pressing the **Reply** button will take you to the messaging page for the user who sent the modmail message. Pressing either **Reply** or **Archive** on an unread modmail message will place the message in the archive section, which is used to identify that you've already seen the message.

## Members
The **Members** tab lists everyone who's a member of your group. A member is defiend as somebody who has joined your group by pressing the **Join** button on the group page. You can change the permissions of a member by pressing their username. The permissions that you can set are:
* **Owner**: Grant this user all moderator permissions, with the additional ability to change potentially dangerous settings, such as adding and removing other moderators and changing the group description and rules.
* **Standard moderator**: Grant this user basic moderator permissions, allowing them to act upon reports and remove posts that violate the rules.
* **Member**: Don't grant this user any moderator permissions. This user will only be able to write, edit and delete their own posts and comments when in this group.
* **Banned user**: Ban this user from this group, preventing them from being able to write their own posts and comments. They can still view and vote on posts.

> **Note:** Only group owners can change the permsisions of its members.

## Settings
On the settings page, you can change the group name, description, rules and mail settings:
* **Group name**: This is the name of your group, which can be visited at **glipo.net/g/<group name>**. The group name cannot be changed, but the casing of the letters in it can be changed.
* **Description**: This is the brief description of your group, which is shown at the top of the group page, below the group name.
* **Rules**: You can add, edit and delete the rules of your group, which will be shown to everyone on the group page. Rules must have both a title and some content that describes more about the rule.
* **Modmail welcome message**: This is the welcome message that is shown on the page where users can compose a modmail message to your group. This can be used to inform users about what they should and should not write in their message.

### Why can't I delete my group?
You can't delete your group because others may find the information on the group you've created to be valuable. We consider groups to be a shared property of a whole community of users, and not just a single user who is the group creator.
