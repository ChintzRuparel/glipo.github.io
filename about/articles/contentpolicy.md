# Glipo Content Policy
## Introduction
Glipo is a platform used by people who want to connect to others and discover their community in individualised user groups. Within these groups, users can post content they find fitting for the group that they are in, comment on others’ posts to engage in conversation about a particular topic, and upvote and downvote on content to quickly express their feelings on other users’ remarks. Glipo hopes to be a medium in which users can make contact with people around the world, provide support for one another, share interesting or humorous content, debate on topics they like, and even create their own communities for others to join in with.

With such capabilities, the need for moderation is strong. Many users need protection from others who are threatening the safety and privacy of people that are both on and off of Glipo. To ensure such protection, Glipo’s staff may be required to impose sanctions against those who use the platform as a weapon against others. Glipo’s staff can apply any number of sanctions ─ and to varying extents ─ to the point where victims can feel comfortable with using the platform again.

Whilst Glipo can connect people together, we understand that not everyone shares the same views. Not every group may be for every user ─ many groups on the site may seem uninteresting to you, and you could find some groups offensive, but the goal of groups is to have a place where its members feel belonged, and not segregated from others. The culture of each and every group is defined by its rules, set out by the moderators of those groups. Rules can be used to determine what behaviour is acceptable, and what the members of a group should expect to do when contributing. We ask you to abide by the rules of the groups that you are in, and to not cause havoc or disrespect with groups that you are not a part of.

To make sure that the moderators of groups don’t cause distrust with members of their respective groups ─ and to ensure that every group can coexist in Glipo in relative harmony ─ we have to impose site-wide rules so that users don’t cause upset to others, irrespective of the group that they are in. These rules are defined within this Content Policy.

## The rules
### Rule 1
Think before you post. Before you press the ‘submit’ or ‘post’ button, give yourself a few seconds to think whether the actions you’re taking will be beneficial and useful to others on Glipo. You should post content that others would not find distasteful or unappealing. No discrimination, hatred, prejudice, sexism or racism should take place on Glipo at all. Nobody likes spammers or trollers, either.

### Rule 2
There’s a human at the other end. Remember that real, living people are going to read your posts and comments. Be polite and don't offend anyone ─ words can hurt. If you're criticising someone's opinion, do so politely and constructively. Unacceptable behaviour can cause others to become annoyed or upset, and unacceptable views do not belong on Glipo. We hope that all of our users are sensitive about the situations that others are in.

### Rule 3
Behave as you would do when you're offline. Pretend that a member of your family is reading your posts ─ it's a good check to see if the content that you're posting is fit for discussion. Whilst the internet can seem very different from real life, much of it has the same effect to others as sending them a physical letter or saying something directly to them. We want our users to realise this indistinct blur between the internet and real life.

### Rule 4
Don't repost unauthentic content that's already posted on the group ─ people don't want to see the same post again once or twice! In addition to this, make sure that you properly attribute others and that you also format your posts correctly. Plagiarism can be detrimental to the credibility of original authors and can often result in a violation of copyright law.

### Rule 5
Make sure that the content you post to Glipo complies with the rules of the group that you're posting to. Additionally, make sure that your content doesn’t violate our Terms of Service. Ensure that all of Glipo’s users have an experience that does not negatively surprise them. Other malicious tactics such as spamming, vote manipulation, computer hacking and social engineering are also unwelcome on Glipo and can often cause interference with legitimate users of the site.

### Rule 6
Respect the privacy of other users on Glipo. Harassing or inciting harassment of others, such as stalking or revealing the personal or confidential information of anyone ─ on or off the site ─ is forbidden. Do not post or threaten to post any intimate or sexually explicit content of anyone, even if those who have made an appearance in the content have given consent. Additionally, do not post or incite the posting of sexual or suggestive content involving children under the age of 18 years.

### Rule 7
Anonymity is accepted and encouraged on Glipo, so don’t post your personal or confidential information without acknowledging the real-life implications that that may have on you. Remember that it is easy to delete unwanted or personal posts and comments that you have previously authored. Never impersonate or defame people or organisations without their explicit consent in a misleading or deceptive way either.

### Rule 8
Don’t share illegal content or content that helps others to engage in illegal activities. Inciting violence is regarded by Glipo as illegal activity, too. All posts must be within compliance with your local resident country’s law, United Kingdom law and international law.

## Enforcement of rules
Our staff have many ways to enforce our rules against those who are breaking them, and can exercise any sanctions to the extent of applicable law. Certain enforcements may be chosen depending on the severity of the violation of this Content Policy, and Glipo’s staff may still ban first-time offenders. A few of the many ways that we can enforce the rules are explained below.

### Verbal enforcement
Our staff may contact you, either publicly on Glipo or through Glipo’s messaging system, to caution you for breaking the rules, whether as a result of accident or negligence.

### Removal of content
Our staff may remove your content from Glipo if we think that other users would find your content uncomfortable, upsetting, angering or distasteful. This sanction can also be given by group moderators, too. You may or may not get a notification when your content is removed.

### Banning of users
If we find that you are a repeat offender, we may need to restrict certain features of your account for a limited or indefinite time, depending on the severity of your actions. You will still be able to browse the site, but you will not be able to post to Glipo. Circumvention of account suspension by the means of creating alternative accounts is also forbidden, and the same enforcement may be applied to accounts on your computer network.

### Restriction or banning of groups
If a particular group is an offender of the Content Policy, the group may be restricted from being able to grow through organic means. In more severe cases, Glipo’s staff may need to ban certain groups for an indefinite time in the event that rule-breaking activities continue within those groups. When a group is banned, it does not mean that your account will be banned too, but in some cases we may have to ban both groups and their users if we find violations of our rules to be severe.

## Reporting violations
If you notice someone who is breaking the rules of a particular group, use the report function on posts or comments that you think violate those rules. Alternatively, you can directly contact moderators of the group by sending them a message via their respective group page.

If you notice someone who is breaking the rules of this Content Policy and you don’t think that we’ve noticed them doing so, you can contact us at [abuse@glipo.net](mailto:abuse@glipo.net) so that we can investigate the matter. Note that not all investigations result in the sanctioning of another user on the site.

Similarly, if you feel that a particular group is breaking the rules of this Content Policy, you should contact us at [abuse@glipo.net](mailto:abuse@glipo.net) so that we can investigate both the moderators and group members accordingly.

### Reporting users who are self-harming or considering suicide
If you see another user on Glipo who is self-harming or considering committing suicide, we strongly suggest that you either select the appropriate option for suicide and self-harm in our content reporting system or contact us at [abuse@glipo.net](mailto:abuse@glipo.net) so that we can provide support and resources to that user. If you feel comfortable with helping the user, we suggest that you keep the conversation with them public, and avoid contacting them through the message function of Glipo. Let them know that you care about getting them out of the situation that they are in, and direct them to resources such as hotlines that help prevent suicide and self-harm.

## Appeals
In some cases, we may find that our enforcement may be too severe for our users. If you are a user who was recently sanctioned and you feel that we made the wrong decision ─ or if you think that you have evolved to become someone who doesn’t violate the rules, you can appeal by visiting [glipo.net/appeal](/appeal).
