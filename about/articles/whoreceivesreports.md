# Who receives content reports?
User-submitted reports are sent to different people depending on the type of report. Some low-severity reports are received by moderators of groups, whereas reports of higher importance are checked by Glipo's staff.

When you report content that breaks a particular rule of the content's group, the group's moderators will check over the report and then take the appropriate actions. Glipo's staff members (who aren't moderators of the group in question) generally don't deal with these types of reports as we believe that it's best for the appropriate group moderators to make the executive decision as to whether or not the content belongs to the appropriate group.

## How can I know if a particular report will be read by group moderators or Glipo staff?
We don't disclose this information because otherwise users will abuse our report triaging system. However, if there are more serious reports that are in low-priority triage categories, Glipo staff will eventually check over these reports (even if it takes longer than reports with higher priorities).

## How can I contact the moderators of a particular group?
If there's problems with a particular type of content that may be breaking the rules of the group, please report the content. For all other matters, you can contact the moderators of a specific group by visiting the group and then pressing the **Message moderators** button. Note that you must be signed in in order to message the moderators.

## How can I contact Glipo's staff?
