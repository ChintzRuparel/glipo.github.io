# How do I start using Glipo?
Joining Glipo is easy and our community is there to support you with your Glipo journey. We're glad to have you on our platform!

The first step to joining Glipo is to sign up for a Glipo account. You can find our **Sign up** button on our [homepage](/). We'll ask you for an email address, a password, and also a unique username that identifies you on the site.

Once you've done that, you can browse Glipo's groups and contribute to the community! Joining groups is a good starting point for discovering your interests ─ when you come across a group you like (for example, g/technology or g/news are popular groups), you can then visit the group page and press the **Join** button. Posts from the groups that you've joined will start to appear on your feed so that you can dive into what interests you!

## Contributing to Glipo
Contributing to Glipo is easy ─ you can either [submit posts to our site](/submit) or comment on posts that you find on your feed or in groups. We encourage you to submit content that you find informative, and that your posts and comments pertain to the topic of their respective groups.

### Upvoting and downvoting
The quickest way to support your opinion is to upvote and downvote on posts and comments. This will then have an impact on the number of people that will see the posts and comments that you've voted on. You can learn more about upvotes and downvotes on our [_What is Glipo?_](?article=whatisglipo.md) article.

### Following the rules
When posting and commenting in Glipo's groups, you are required to follow the rules of the group that you're posting or commenting in. Rules are put in place to ensure that groups are kept safe and so that they only contain content that pertains to the groups' topics. You can find the rules on the sidebar on a group page, or if you're on mobile, under **Group info** > **View group rules**.

In addition to following group rules, you also need to follow the rules of our [Content Policy](?article=contentpolicy.md).

## Can I use Glipo anonymously?
Yes, on the condition that if you want to participate in groups, you must sign up ─ you can choose any username you'd like, as long as it follows our name formatting rules (only alphanumeric characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, between 3 and 20 characters long) and that the username that you chose hasn't already been taken by another user. We suggest that you sign up with your main email address, but we won't show your email address to others.

## Can I have multiple accounts?
We allow our users to have alternative accounts (often called _alt accounts_). However, we forbid our users from creating alternative accounts to circumvent any group-wide or site-wide bans.
