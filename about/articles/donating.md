# Donating to Glipo
As a group who values sharing with others over advertising, we kindly ask our users to donate a small amount to us to ensure that the future of Glipo remains bright. We ask that you donate today so that Glipo remains funded by its userbase. Simply [visit our donation page](/about/donate.html) and enter an amount to donate.

Once you've donated, we won't show you donation prompts again when you're signed into your Glipo Account. You can still donate again later.

## What do I need to donate?
You'll need a bank card (debit/credit card) to process the donation with. You can also alternatively donate using Google Pay. We kindly ask that you only donate funds which have been obtained from legitimate sources â”€ we won't accept money that you've made from theft, for example.

## Can I refund my donation?
Your donation is non-refundable as you are not purchasing a physical product, and therefore we do not provide warranty. If you think that someone has made a donation with your details and without your consent, please [contact us](mailto:hi@glipo.net) within 48 hours of discovery so that we can restore your lost funds.
