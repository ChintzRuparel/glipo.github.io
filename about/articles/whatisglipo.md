# What is Glipo?
Glipo is an online social network that enables users to discuss about the things they love in what we call groups. Community is at the heart of Glipo, and our group-based system allows our users to join the groups that they find interesting. Groups allow people to talk about a particular interest, be up-to-date on a certain topic, or hang out with other like-minded people.

## What does g/ mean?
Groups on Glipo are identified by their group name ─ which all begin with `g/`. For example, if you're looking for posts about technology, the g/technology group would be suitable for you. What's useful is that you can directly visit a Glipo group through your brower's address bar ─ so going back to the g/technology example, all you need to do is type in the web address [glipo.net/g/technology](https://glipo.net/g/technology).

The same naming rule applies to usernames too, except that usernames start with `u/`.

## What do the voting buttons do?
We let our users express themselves through a variety of interactive options, but one of the main and quickest ways to express your opinion about a post or comment is to use either the upvote or downvote button. You can only press one or the other, and you can only give a maximum of one vote per post or comment (you can, however, undo your vote). Voting affects the chances that other users discover a post or comment ─ if you upvote a post, that post will be seen by more people. Likewise, if you downvote a post, the post will not be seen by as many people.

### Why am I getting loads of downvotes?
Downvotes are often given by users who have different opinions on the topic that you've posted about. We encourage our users to respect others and their opinions, and downvoting is one of the easiest and most respectful ways to share differing views. If you've got a downvote on your post or comment, don't worry ─ others may also agree with you and upvote your post. We suggest that you don't delete your posts and comments that are downvoted as other users may also be on your side.

### What are points?
Our points-based system enables us to see how experienced you are at using Glipo. The number of points you have appear on your user profile, and everybody can see the figure. You gain points when somebody upvotes one of your posts or comments, and you lose points when somebody downvotes them. The points-based system is primarily used to prevent spam on the platform and to distinguish good-quality posts from posts that may violate Glipo's rules.
