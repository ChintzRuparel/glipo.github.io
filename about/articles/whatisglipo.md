# What is Glipo?
Glipo is an online social network that enables users to discuss about the things they love in what we call groups. Community is at the heart of Glipo, and our group-based system allows our users to join the groups that they find interesting. Groups allow people to talk about a particular interest, be up-to-date on a certain topic, or hang out with other like-minded people.

## What does g/ mean?
Groups on Glipo are identified by their group name ─ which all begin with `g/`. For example, if you're looking for posts about technology, the g/technology group would be suitable for you. What's useful is that you can directly visit a Glipo group through your brower's address bar ─ so going back to the g/technology example, all you need to do is type in the web address [glipo.net/g/technology](https://glipo.net/g/technology).
