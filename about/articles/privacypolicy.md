# Glipo Privacy Policy
By using Glipo, you're trusting us with your data. We want to make sure that this trust is maintained and that you can continue to keep your data safe, and so we outline our data protection practices in this Privacy Policy. Glipo Technologies won't share your data with any third parties except as described in this policy.

## Applicable data protection law
For the purposes of data protection, Glipo Technologies follows any applicable data protection legislation that is currently in force in the United Kingdom, including the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679), as well as any other applicable European Union regulations relating to privacy for so long as and to the extent that the law of the European Union has legal effect in the United Kingdom.

This Privacy Policy, in conjunction with the Glipo Terms of Service and any additional agreements which are incorporated by reference into the Glipo Terms of Service applies to your use of Glipo. This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

## What we may collect about you
We may collect and process the following data about you when you use Glipo:

* **Information which you give us:** When filling in forms, signing up to Glipo, contacting us by email or otherwise, you may be giving us information about you. This information may include your username, password, email address, and any additional information which you provide while using Glipo.
* **Information which we collect about you:** When using Glipo (both when signed in or out), we may collect information about your device (such as the device you use, network information, and any relevant software which is on your device such as operating system and web browser), details of your use of Glipo (such as the pages you visit), and data used for statistical purposes (such as generalised current location and time spent on Glipo).

## How we use your data
Glipo uses the information held about you in many ways:

* **Information you give us:** We may use this information to provide you the Glipo service experience and load associated information about you for you to view, to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, and to ensure that Glipo is presented to you in the most effective way for both you and your device.

## How your information is stored
All information which you provide to us is stored on secure servers which are situated in either the European Economic Area (EEA) or a GDPR-compliant international location. Where international data processors are used, all appropriate technical and legal safeguards are put in place to ensure that you are given the same level of protection as within the EEA.

Where we have given you ─ or where you have chosen ─ a password which enables you to access certain features of Glipo, you are responsible for the confidentiality of said password. We ask you not to share your passwords with anyone, on or off of Glipo.

The transmission of information via the internet may not always be completely secure, and although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your personal information is secure when it is transmitted to and from Glipo. Any data transmission is at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we use strict procedures and security features to help prevent access by unauthorised parties.

## Privacy practices regarding children under 13 years of age
You must be of at least 13 years of age in order to use Glipo, as per the Glipo Terms of Service, unless Glipo authorises such usage in writing. Glipo does not address anyone under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 years without parental consent. In the case that we discover that a child under the age of 13 years has provded us with personal information, we will immediately take action to prevent the appropriate data from being processed or disclosed in the future by deleting it. If you are a parent or guardian and you are are aware that your child has provided Glipo with personal information, please contact us at [hi@glipo.net](mailto:hi@glipo.net) so that we can investigate the situation.

## Access to information
The relevant data protection legislation gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance to such legislation.

## Future changes to this Privacy Policy
From time to time, Glipo may update this Privacy Policy. Thus, you are advised to periodically review this Privacy Policy for any changes. Changes that are made are effective immediately after they are provided.
